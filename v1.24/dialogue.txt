I guess I'll go level up by grinding the Dungeon.
3 hours of grinding later...
Damn, these ants are getting easier.
I can even solo the Queen Ant now. I must be too high level.
I'm just gonna finish this last mob and head back to town.
KyaaaAAAAAHHH!
What?!
Hey there [m]! You look much stronger since the last time I've seen you.
HEY!? You KS'd me!
Let's call it kill secure! Ok? ;)
Whatever.
Hey, you wanna party up instead? That way our exp is shared.
Alright, I guess that sounds good. Let me just clear my inventory back in the town square.
U set? ;:^)
Yep, let's go to the wasteland to grind higher level mobs.
I'll focus on supporting, you can go on the offense.
I need to level up my white magic anyways.
Sounds good bby. <3 ;)

Welcome to the Land of Ferrous, [mc_race]
Would you like to know the basics?
I'm good. I've played multiple MMORPGs before.
Okay, now initiating tutorial stages.
Are you kidding me?
You are playing an MMORPG which stands for...
Seriously?! This is worse than Kingdom Kokoro 2's tutorial!
The first MMORPG created was...
Why did they even implement this in the game? *yawn*
Congratulations! You've completed the tutorial.
zzZzzZzZZz
Nyan?
zzZzzZzZZz
Nyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
{i}Bobo jumps on your face.{/i}
WAHHHHHH! BOBO!
Oh...I fell asleep.
Nyan. -_-
At least I finished that stupid tutorial.
How long was I out for?
{i}You check the time and it reads 3PM.{/i}
SHIT! There goes my headstart!
Might as well start with what I can.
{b}[player_ign] is now online.{/b}
I need to get started on finding some quests.
{i}You look around the Town Square, searching for available quests.{/i}
{i}You notice a large NPC with an exclamation point above his head.{/i}
Did someone say quest? :^)
Wow, it's like they know what I'm saying in real life.
Yes, we do.
What the hell?
I need Slime Gels for my daughter's 20th birthday party.
Can you hunt and gather me 5 Slime Gels?
Yes. Seems easy enough, but what kind of birthday party needs Slime Gels?
Okaaay?
This is pretty easy. I mean it IS the first quest.
I just need 2 more slime gels.
{i}As you look for the last few slimes, you notice a girl having a difficult time dealing with two slimes.{/i}
Just die! Just dieeeee already!
{i}You notice the girl attacking the slime with her fists.{/i}
You know it'd be easier to kill it if you equip your weapon first.
I don't need your help! I can handle it just fine.
Alright. Good luck.
{i}Meiko notices she isn't doing any damage.{/i}
This is gonna take me hours!
Uhh, wait! Could you at least show me how to equip my weapon before you go?
Geez, did you even do the tutorial?
I did, but I didn't really pay attention.
Well, we might as well just party up, so I can teach you the basics.
F-F-FFine, but only until I finish this quest!
Thanks.
I'm helping you!
Alright, I get it! Can you please help me?
Well, to start off, an MMORPG stands for ...
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH EQUIPPING WEAPONS?!
It should've taken us 4 minutes, but I had to guide her through it.
Thanks again.
Let me add you.
Oh okay, sure.
Good job everyone. Don't forget to do your homework and enjoy your summer!
Pssst! What are you doing over your summer break?
I'm going to get a copy of that new game that's coming out tonight!
Are you going to the midnight release?
I wish!! My mom won't let me go, she says its too late...
Aww man, that sucks...
Sucks for them, good thing I already pre-ordered it.
Don't have to wait in those long ass lines.
Oh! Meiko before you go.
Hm???
Make sure to really focus on your homework. You don't want to get held back now! haha
...
ok
Man, it would suck to be called out like that in front of the class...
I heard that Professor Kim and and Meiko's dad are close friends.
Ahh, so that's why he always picks on her like that.
Or the fact that she never does her homework...
Anyways, class is over and the game doesn't come out until midnight so I have a couple of hours to myself.
Maybe I can use that time to go home and finally catch up on that anime that I was watching.
I forget the name, but I think it was called Your Truth in March...
...or something like that.
How is it only 6PM????
I already finished watching the whole season...
And I dont really have anything else to do right now.
I guess i'll go check out the game's forums.
{i}You boot up your computer and go to a gaming news site.{/i}
{i}At the top of the screen you see read:{/i}
{b}"MMOHOT FIRST LOOK AT ARC'S END"{/b}
{b}Most anticipated MMORPG of the year is set to release tonight at midnight!{/b}
{b}Arc's End has reached a new record of 720,000 copies pre-ordered!{/b}
{b}Save the land of Ferrous from the Corrupted God, Arc and fight alongside allies.{/b}
There are already a bunch of forum posts on the game's website.
Mainly about predictions on the classes they might have or the kind of monsters we might see.
One post catches my eye though, apparently he was a beta tester so he got to see the game early.
So he made a list of all the things he expects to be in the final release.
He even posted screenshots of the menu screen when he still had access to the beta.
Wow, this actually looks legit.
Even though I've been waiting for this game for a long time, there hasn't really been any leaked information up to this point.
So, to find any kind of information on Arc's End, whether its real or not, is pretty exciting.
I can't believe there's so much to this game. I wish I could have been a beta tester.
Not like I could have played anyways...I was so busy at school because my mom would be on my ass anytime she saw me playing games on a school night...
I don't blame her though, she wants me to go to a big university, since she wasn't able to afford it when she was my age.
But since it's summer there's nothing she can do about it now.
I love my mom, but all the late nights I spent studying is driving me insane.
You can only read so much about "The history of World Economics" and "Micro-Biology" before your brain starts mixing the two together.
One time in class, the teacher asked me when the US Stock Market Crash happened.
and I answered with "The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell."
Needless to say, that wasn't the right answer...
So this summer break is much needed.
Oh, it's already almost time for the game to release. I should probably head over to the game store soon.
I'll be back Bobo. Protect the house while I'm gone.
Nyan~ :3
{i}As you walk towards the GameGo store, you see that the line is already a good two blocks away from the store.{/i}
Woah...I didn't expect the line to be that long. Good thing the pre-order line isn't as long.
{i}As your walking to the line you notice two girls pass by with distinct expressions.{/i}
{i}One of them is wearing really large glasses with this weird smile on her face, while the person she is walking with seems to be more calm but excited at the same time.{/i}
Aaaaaaahhhhhh~~ I can't believe we finally got it!! I've been waiting so long for this!!!
Hey, calm down. Aren't you getting a little too excited?
Which race are you gonna make?
You're not even listening to a word I'm saying, are you...?
I think I'm gonna go with the Elf race!
...
It seems like the game is attracting all kinds of people.
Wait... is that...
...the girl who got called out in class earlier today?
Meiko, wasn't it?
What's with that face she has on right now...
WAAAAAAHHHHH!! The line is so long!
I knew I should've gotten here earlier!
Mom's gonna kill me if I stay out too late!
Hey! The lines back there!
Oh, s-s-sorry mister I didn't realize!!
I guess she didn't pre-order the game.
Weird she doesn't seem like the "gamer" type.
She seems like the type who spends all day chasing a butterfly.
Only to realize after catching it, that it was a bird the whole time.
Hi, I'm here to pick up a copy of Arc's End.
Sir, may I see your ID?
Okay! Here's your copy, [player_name]. Enjoy!
Thank you!
Man, I finally got my copy.
{i}As you're walking out of GameGo, you still see Meiko in line. She looks to have calmed down from whatever happened when you first saw her.{/i}
{i}But she is no where near close to getting her copy yet.{/i}
She's probably gonna be there for a while...
Oh well, that's not my problem, it's time to go home and play this game finally!
I'm home Bobo!
Nya...
Bobo seems to have been sleeping since I left. Some guard cat he is...
I should probably sleep, but I really want to get a headstart on this game.
{i}You insert your disc into your PC and boot up the game.{/i}
{i}The next morning...{/i}
NYAAAAAAAA!
WAAHHHHH! STOP THAT BOBO!
Ugh, Bobo, why do you never let me sleep in?
Nyan~
Alright Bobo, let me up.
{i}You set Bobo down.{/i}
I better login before I get put in the waiting queue.
Oh, there's a patch.
Good timing, I can eat some breakfast while this patch downloads.
Might as well read through the forums.
Oh, there's a new event! That must be the patch downloading right now.
{b}Exclusive Launching Event!{/b}
{b}Players will be given the chance to obtain an exclusive costume or equipment and a handfull of supplies from a duo dungeon quest.{/b}
{b}This quest is available to all levels.{/b}
{b}Rewards are limited and event lasts only for 3 days, so good luck adventurers and make sure to use your time wisely!{/b}
Ooooooh! That sounds toasty.
{i}You scarf down the rest of your breakfast and hurry back to your room.{/i}
Perfect, the patch is done.
{b}[player_ign] is now online.{/b}
{b}NEW Quest Available! {/b}
{b}Summer Days{/b}
{b}Objective: Travel to the Underwater Grotto of Undine and collect 3 fish eggs.{/b}
Hey, this quest seems rather easy.
{i}You try to accept the quest, but it won't go through.{/i}
{b}The quest requires a party of two.{/b}
Ah shit, I forgot this was a duo quest.
I can't accept it yet. I need to find a partner since this quest is a duo quest.
Let me check my friend's list.
{i}You check your friend's list and see that you only have one friend added, ||MeiMei98||{/i}
Ugh, I forgot that I haven't really added people yet.
{i}You notice that most of the people surrounding the quest NPC are already paired up in duos.{/i}
Hmm, I guess I can try General Chat to see if anyone is looking for a partner.
{b}Summer Days looking for 1.{/b}
{b}SD L41{/b}
{b}Grotto l41{/b}
{b}Summer quest one more{/b}
{b}Oni Gunji one more{/b}
Jeez, this chat is soooo spammy.
I might as well just wait for a whisper or something.
{b}||MeiMei98|| is now online.{/b}
Whoa, that timing is way too perfect. Time to pair up with her.
You click the whisper tab under MeiMei's name.
Yo, are you down to pair up with me for the event quest?
Aren't you fast. Well I guess...since you're my only friend for now.
Don't think that I'm doing this just because you're my only friend!
Uh ok, sounds good.
What's with this girl?
I heard the rewards are pretty good!
Where did you hear that?
I read it on MMOHOTS.
Oooo I go on that site too!
I do recall seeing some people say they got some pretty good equips on the forums.
My friend from Datcord told me about that site.
Datcord? What's that?
It's a VoIP program.
Umm...VoIP?
Yea, it's like Swype, but for gaming.
Swype?
It's for talking!
Ahh ok ok. I see...
By the way, do you have a mic?
I do, but for what?
This game has a voice channel within their party interface.
Really? I didn't know this game had that...
Alright, how do we do it?
Okay, so hover your cursor over the social tab and click on "Create Party."
Once you do that, click on add friends and choose me.
BTW, you can only have 4 people at maximum in a party.
Wow, this makes communicating much easier! Now I know.
Don't get me wrong! I just wanted to make things easier you know!
What is she trying to get at...?
{i}You send MeiMei the party invite.{/i}
Hmmm, this will be my first time talking to someone I just met online.
Let alone a girl...Or a guy...?
{b}||MeiMei98|| joins the party and voice channel.{/b}
{b} You now fufill the minimum amount of party members to accept the Summer Days quest!
Sweet now we can do the quest!
{i}Ahhhhhhhhhhhh! I just realized I'll be talking to some random person online.{/i}
{i}This is gonna be so awkward! What do I say? Is this person actually a guy?{/i}
{i}I hope she's a girl. I don't know how to talk to guys! Ahhh, why did I mention it?!{/i}
{i}Ok, ok, everything will be fine. Just act normal.{/i}
Hello? Mei Mei?
Uh...Hello?
H-hi...
...
Wait...That's it?
N..Nice to meet you...
This voice...
Sounds kind of familiar.
Hey, uh you didn't have to greet me so formally.
Sorry, that's just what I say when I meet someone.
Are you ready?
Yeah, but the grotto is pretty far so we should stock up on some food before we go.
Pfffft, I don't need food, I'm a tank. I have some of the best health regen stats in the game!
{i}Tanks{/i} for letting me know.
Ha. You're funny...
It doesn't hurt to have some food just in case.
You never know. It might come in handy in a tough battle.
I guess you're right.
Well, I'll head over to the merchant real quick to get some items, stay here.
Hey! Don't give me commands like that! I'm not your dog or anything!
Good dog! :3
Hmmmph!
Welcome to my Shop, traveler.
Have you come to see my fares?
Yes, I need to stock up on some supplies for the Summer Days Event.
Due to the recent event, we are low on supplies and our options have been limited.
Unfortunately, I can only sell you one item.
What will it be?
Thank you for your patronage.
Here's your [food].
These will come in handy. Thank you sir!
If your planning on doing the Summer Days event, this might come in handy.
{i}The merchant hands you a scroll with unfamiliar writing.{/i}
What is this?
It's a return scroll. It can bring you back to the nearest town if you ever get in a pinch.
Oh wow, Thanks again!
Hey, what took you so long?
Why, did you miss me? Hahaha!
WHAT?? N-N-NO! It's not like I was worried about you or anything.
What are you a tsundere?
Hmph!
Anyways, I just got some food for the road.
I won't be need that, but I know you will!
Well, it's not for you anyways.
...let's just go.
--KO!! DO YOUR HOMEWORK!
MOM! Summer school hasn't even started yet! I don't have any homework!
You should always have homework! Study to catch up to your classmates.
...
Ugh, I will later, okay?
Anyways, sorry about that.
So...Kou, huh?
Ahh! Don't call me that. That's so embarrassing...
That's what my mom always calls me.
Alright alright, I won't.
I should probably refrain from asking for her real name.
I don't want to sound creepy now, but it's a little awkward.
Let's try to lift the spirits up a bit.
So you're a student too I'm guessing?
Yeah, and I have supplementary summer classes soon.
School...isn't really my strong suit.
Awww, that sucks. I don't have school again 'til August.
Must be nice, I didn't do so well this past semester, so I have to catch up.
I bet you're worse! Hmph!
I'm just playing around. You're not that bad. Hahaha!
T-T-Thanks...
Didn't I say not to talk about my name?
You're so creepy.
I shouldn't have pushed it.
We should get going. I don't like being in this forest.
Why? Are you scared?
Not really. As long as you're here, Kou. ;:^)
W-what?! What are you saying?!
Just teasin'. Do you see that? Looks like a cave.
Seems like we're almost at the grotto.
Ugh, you're so annoying.
uz a bich azz nibba
u
tryna
fuh
or
wuh
??
Is that it right there?
I think it is. The quest indicator is glowing so it means we're nearing the area.
Alright, let's get this over with.
Wow, the graphics for this dungeon are so pretty!
Yeah, but you know what is prettier?
W-what!?!?
What?
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
Oh, I thought I heard you say something...
You have a cat?
Yeah his name is Bobo.
Oh, I love cats!
Well, my cat is fat, lazy, and useless.
Just like you!
...you don't even know me.
I know enough.
Uhh...ok.
I shouldn't have told her that.
Hmm...there doesn't seem to be anyone here though.
...except those three susFISHous men over there.
Did you just say susfishous?
{i}You see three large fish standing on two legs holding tridents blocking your path.{/i}
Who are you?
State your purpose.
Pssst Meiko! I think they're guarding the fish eggs.
What should we do?
Let me do the talking.
Oh we are just adventurers, exploring the land.
So you two are lovers, traveling the land?
What a cute couple!
No! No! No! IT'S NOT LIKE THAT!
We're actually just here for your fish eggs!
WHAT?! You're here for our queen's children?
This idiot...
Looks like we have a couple of FISHBAIT.
PREPARE TO GET FILLETED
Well, MeiMei, looks like we're having sushi tonight.
What's with all these puns?
I guess my food can come in handy right about now.
{i}You eat the mutton.{/i}
{b}[player_ign]'s attack stat drastically rose for 15 seconds.{/b}
Woah! Where did that come from?
It's the mutton I guess.
I didn't know you get buffs from food.
My defenses aren't too high, so take aggro and I'll strike them from the back.
Okay, got it!
{b}||MeiMei98|| used Taunt.{/b}
Hey, I just had fish tacos for dinner last night!
What?! How dare you eat our brethren?
{i}The fishmen charged at Meiko.{/i}
Water gun!
{i}I can't die here. This would be humiliating for a tank! I'd die from embarrassment!{/i}
Whirlwind strike!
{i}You strike all three Sahagins in one blow.{/i}
Phew! That was a close one!
I hate to admit it, but I guess the food came in handy.
Did you say something?
...N-Nothing!
Let's get this over with. Help me pick up three fish eggs.
{i}You and Meiko spend the next few minutes searching for the fish eggs.{/i}
Hey eat this! It will boost your defense!
Why? I don't need it!
Do you see how strong they are??
I guess... F-f-ffine!
{i} You give the turtle stew to ||MeiMei98||.{/i}
{b}MeiMei's defense stat drastically rose for 15 seconds.{/b}
I didn't really need it, but thanks...
Ok, the plan is you take aggro and stall, while I flank and steal the fish eggs.
{b}||MeiMei98|| used Taunt{/b}
Alright, SUSHI MEN OVER HERE!!
The fishmen, enraged, charge towards MeiMei
Take this!
Water gun!
SPLASH!!
Hahaha! Their attacks are barely leaving a dent!
But, you need to hurry my buff is wearing off.
One
Two!
And thats the last one, Three! Got it!
Let's get out of here MeiMei!
{i}||MeiMei98|| charges at the Sahagins, momementarily stunning them{/i}
Alright! I'm right behind you!
{i} You guys make it out of the grotto before the Sahagins have time to recover.
{i}You eat the rabbit's foot.{/i}
{b}[player_ign]'s agility stat drastically rose for 15 seconds.{/b}
Where did you get that?!
Heh, I'll be back in a second.
Hmph! I'll do what I want!
Even with that, you won't be able to pass me kid!
Yeah! Get him!
{i}All Sahagins roar and start running towards you.{/i}
{i}[player_ign] blinks towards them.{/i}
{i}Sahagin 1 tries to attack you, but you dodge his attack to the left.{/i}
{i}Sahagin 3 uses water gun on you, but you dodge the skill by ducking.{/i}
{i}Sahagin 2 throws his trident at you, but you dodge by jumping on the trident and using it as leverage to jump over them.{/i}
{i}You grab the eggs and turn around to see all Sahagins' in anger looking at you.{/i}
Grrr, die kid!
{i}As the Sahagins were all distracted by you, you realize that their backs were left open for MeiMei to attack.{/i}
MeiMei, now!
Agh! Don't tell me what to do!!!
Take this you uglies!
Meiko smashes each Sahagin in the head causing critical hits leaving them stunned for a few seconds.
Hehe, nice job MeiMei.
We finished this job pretty quickly, huh?
Of course I did a good job, what did you expect?...dummy!
Heh, alright let's take these back for our rewards.
{b}Bring the eggs to the fisherman by the dock{/b}
Sweet!
But now we have to walk ALL the way back to town!
Good thing I picked up this scroll!
How is paper going to help us?
Well, it's a return scroll that teleports you to the nearest town.
The merchant in town gave it to me just before I left.
Yay! That means we don't have to walk!
Well the thing is...
He only gave me one.
...
Well, see you in town!
W-w-wait!!!
{b}[player_ign] used a return scroll.{/b}
What an asshole...
How was the walk?
Hmph!
It's fine, we can walk together.
Hmm...are you sure?
Yeah, there's probably going to be a bunch of mobs on the way.
Are you saying I can't protect myself?!
Well I guess I'll my scroll then...
Wait!I-I didn't mean it like that. I just didn't wanna walk alone.
But don't get the wrong idea!
This d-d-doesn't mean anything!
Fine by me.
Wow, that went by a lot faster than I thought.
